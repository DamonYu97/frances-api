## Important

Place chapbooks_metadata_pages.yml or any other results files obtained from running (write_pages_df_yml)[https://github.com/francesNLP/defoe/blob/master/defoe/nls/queries/write_pages_df_yml.py] query in the folder results.

Late execute in this order:
1. Metadata_Pages_NLS.ipynb --> it will create a dataframe (from your defoe result file) and store it here.
2. Dataframe2RDF.ipynb -> it will create a knowlege graph (from the previous dataframe file) and store it here. 



You can practice SPAQL queries using  QueringRDF.ipynb
