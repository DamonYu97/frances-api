       "'hollow bags. Whett feeds are thus sufficiently malted, they mult be dried in malt-kilns, the fuel of which ftiould smoke as little as poflible.—The hulks mull now be broke open by malt-milns, and then infused or riialh’ed nn warm water, in order to extradt the faccharine substance; the heat applied Ihould be very slow and gradual. Thus the malt is diflblved, and lies till the liquor be sufficiently tindiured. When the malt is too long diffused, so that an acetous fermentation begins to take place, it Is called blinking, or foxing, by brewers. This tindlure obtained from the infusion of grinded malt, is commonly known by the name ok onort. We lhall now give an account of this process in the language and manner of the adhial brewer, which will probably be more acceptable than treating it in a philosophical manner. Of making Malt. The barley mull be put into a leaden or tiled cistern, that holds five, teh, or more quarters, and covered with Water four or six inches above the barley, to allow for its swell. Here it must lie five or six tides, as the rbaltller calls it, reckoning twelve hours to the tide, according as the barley is in body or in driness. The way to know when it is enough, is to take a corn, end-ways. Between the fingers, arid gently crufli it; and if it be in all pat ts mellow, and the hulk opens, or Harts a little from the body of the corn, then it is enough . The nice ty of this is a material point; for if it be infused too\" much, the sweetness of the malt will be greatly taken off, and yield the less spirit, and will cause deadness and fourness in ale or beer in a Ihort time, for the goodness of the malt contributes much to the preservation of all ales and beers. Then the water must be well drained from it, and it will come equal and better on the floor, which may be done in twelve or sixteen hours in temperate weather, but in cold near thirty. From the cistern, it is pm into a Iquare hutch or couch\\' , where it must lie thirty flours; then it must be worked night and day in one or two heaps, as the weather is cold or hot, and turned every four, six, or eight hours, the outward part inwards, and the bottom upwards, always keeping a clear floor, that the corn that lies next to it be not chilled; and as soon as it begins to come or spire, then turn it every three, four, or five hours, as was done before, According to the temper of the air, which greatly governs this management; and as it comes or works more, so must the heap be fpreaded and thinned larger to cool it. Thus it may lie and be worked on the floor in several parallels, two or three feet thick, ten or more feet broad, and fourteen or more in length, to chip or spire, but not too much nor too fast; and when it is come enough, it is to be turned twelve or sixteen times in twenty four hours, if the season is warm, as in March, April, or May; and when it is fixed, and the root begins to be dead then it must be thickened again, and carefully kept often turned and worked, that the growing of the root may not revive, and this is better done with the Sloes off than on : And here the Workman’s art and diligence ia particular is tried, in keeping the floor clear, and turning the malt often, that it neither moulds nor acre-spires, that is, that the blade does not grow out at the opposite end of the root; for, if it does, the flower and strength of the malt is gone, and nothing left behind but the acre-spire, hulk, and tail: Now, when it is at this degree, and sit for the kiln, it is often put into a heap, and let lie twelve hours before it is turned, to heat and mellow, which wilf much improve the malt if it is done with moderation, and after that time it must be turned every six hours during twenty-four ; but if it is overheated, it will become like grease and be spoiled, or at least cause the drink to be unwholesome. When this operation is over, it then must be put on the kiln, to dry four, six, or twelve hours, according to the nature of the malt; for the pale sort requires more leisure, and less fire, than the amber or brown sorts: Three inches thick was formerly thought a sufficient depth for the malt to lie on the hair-cloth ; but now six is often allowed it; fourteen of sixteen feet square will dry about two quarters, if the malt lies four inches thick, and here it ftiould be turned every two, three, or four hours, keeping the hair cloth clear: The time of preparing it from the cistern to the kiln is uncertain, according to the season of the year; in moderate weather, three weeks are often sufficient. When the malt is dried, it must not cool on the kiln, but be direftly thrown off, not into a heap, but fpreaded wide in an airy place, till it is thoroughly cool; then put it into a heap, or otherwise dispose of it. There are several methods used in drying of malts, as the iron-plate frame, the tile-frame, that are both full of little holes; the brass-wired, and iron-wired frame, and the hair-cloth. The iron and tiled ones were chiefly invented for drying of brown malts, and saving of fuel; for these, when they come to be thorough hot, will make the corns crack and jump by the fierceness of their heat, so that they will be roasted or fcorcbed in a little time ; and after they are off the kiln, to plump the body of the corn, and make it take the eye, some will sprinkle water over it, that it may meet with the better market: But if such malt is not used quickly, it will slacken and lose its spirits to a great degree, and perhaps, in half a year or less, may be taken by the whools and spoiled. Such hasty dryings, or fcorchings, are also apt to bitter the .malt, by burning its skin, and therefore these kilns\\' are not so much used now as formerly. The wire-frames indeed are something better, yet they are apt to scorch the outward part of the dorn, that cannot be got off so soon as the hair-cjoth admits of, for these must be swept when the other is only turned at once; however, these last three ways are now in much request for drying pale and amber malts, because their fire may be kept with more leisure, and the malt more gradually and better dryed. But by many the hair cloth is reckoned the best. Malts are dried with several sorts of fuel; as the coak, Welch coal, straw, wood, and fern, &c. But the coak is reckoned by most to exceed all others for making drink of the finest flavour and pale colour, because it sends no smoke forth to hurt the malt with any offensive tang, that wood, fern, and straw are apt to doin a lefler or greater degree; but there is a difference part of it of a hard<barley nature, and weigh heavier than even in what is called coak, the right sort being large that which is true malt. pitcoal charred or burnt in some measure to a cinder, till all the sulphur is consumed and evaporated, which is called choak ; and this, when it is truly made, is the best of all other fuels. But if there be but one cinder as big as an egg, not thoroughly cured, the smoke of this one is capable of doing damage, which happens too often by the negligence or avarice of the choak-maker : There is another sort, by. some wrongly called choak, and rightly named culm or Welch-coal, from Swanzey in Pembrokeshire, being of a hard stony substance, in small bits, resembling a fhinning coal, and will burn without smoke, and by its fulphureous effluvia call a most excellent whiteness on all the outward parts of the grainy body: In Devonfflire their marble or grey fxre-stone is burnt into lime with the strong fire that this culm makes, and both this and the chalked pit-coal afford a moderate and certain fire to all malt that is dried by it. Straw is the next sweetest fuel; but wood and fern are the worst. Some put a peck or more of pease, and malt them with five quarters of barley, to mellow the drink : Beans are used for the same purpose; but they do not come so soon, nor mix so conveniently with the malt, as the pea. Barley is not sit to make malt of till it is fully mellowed and sweated in the mow, and the season of the year is ready for it, without both which there can be no assurance of good malt. This untimely making of malt often occasions bad ales and beers; for such malt retaining some of its barley nature* or that the season of the year is not cold enough to admit of its natural working on the floor, is not capable of producing a true malt, but will cause its drink to (link in the calk instead of growing sit for use, as not having its genuine malt nature to cure and preserve it, which all good malts contribute to as well as the hop. Mellilet, a most stinking weed that grows among barley, if not thoroughly cleaned from it before malting, makes the drink so heady, that it is apt to intoxicate the unwary by drinking a small quantity : Besides, it gives a nauseous flavour to the liquor. To know good from bad Malts. F1 rst, break the mak-corn across between the teeth, in the middle, or at both ends, and if it tafteth mellow and sweet, has a round body, breaks soft, is full of flour all its length, smells well, and has a thin Ikin, then it isgood Secondly, take a glass near full of water, and put in some malt ; if it swims, it is right; but if any sinks to the bottom, then it is not true malt, but steely, and retains somewhat of its barley nature; this, however, is not an infallible rule, because, if a corn of malt is cracked, split, or broke, it will then take the water and sink ; but an allowance may be given for futh incidents,, and still room enough to make a judgment. Thirdly, malt that is truly made will not be hard and steely, but of so mellow a nature, that, if forced against a dry. board, it will mark, and cast a white colour almost like chalk. Fourthly, malt that is not rightjy made will be Of the Nature and life of Pale, Amber, and Brown Malts. -The pale malt is the slowest and flackeft dried of any, and where it has had a leisure fire, a sufficient time allowed it on the kiln, and a due care taken of it, the flour of the grain will remain in its full quantity, and thereby produce a greater length of wort than the brown high-dried malt. It may be brewed either with spring or common well water. The amber-coloured malt is that which is dried in a medium degree, between the pale and the brown, arid is very much in use, as being free of either extreme. Its colour is pleasant, its taste agreeable, and its nature wholesome, which makes it be preferred by many as the best of malts ; this by some is brewed either with hard or soft waters, or a mixture of both. The brown malt is the soonest and highest dried of any, even till it is so hard, that it is difficult to bite some of its corns asunder. This malt, by some, is thought to occasion the gravel or stone, and is by its steely nature Ids nourilhing than the pale or amber malts, being very much impregnated with the fiery particles of the kiln, and therefore its drink sooner becomes ftiarp and acid than that made from the pale or amber sorts, if they are all fairly brewed: For this reason the London brewers mostly use the Thames or, New River waters to brew this malt with, for the sake of its lost nature, whereby it agrees with the harfli qualities of it better than any of the well or other hard sorts, and makes a luscious ale for a little while, and abut-beer, or porter, that will keep very wdl five or six months ; but after that time it ge; nerally grows stale, notwithstanding there be ten or twelve bushels allowed to the hogftiead, and it be hopped ac» cordingly. Pale and amber malts dried with coak or culm, obtain a more clean, bright, pale colour, than if dried with any other fuel; because there is not smoak to darken and fully their ficins or hulks, and give them an ill rtlafti,which those malts have, more or less, that are dried with straw, wood, or fern, drc. The coak or Welch coal also makes more true and compleat malt than any other fuel, because its fire gives both a gentle and certain heat, whereby the corns are in all their parts gra-i dually, dried; and therefore of late these malts have gained such a reputation, that great quantities have been consumed in most parts, of the nation for their whole-t some nature and sweet fine taste. Next to the coak-dried malt, the straw dried is the sweetest and best tasted : This, it must be acknowledged, is fometimeswell malted, where the barley, wheat,; straw, convemencies, and the maker’s Ikill, are good; but as the fire of the straw is not so regular-as the coak, the malt is attended with more uncertainty in its making,; because it is dilficult to keep it to a moderate and equalheat, and also exposes the malt in some degree to the taste of the smoak. Brown malts are dried with straw, wood, and fern;Yti:. the straw-dried is the bcft; the wood-sort has a mofl: ungrateful taste, and few can .bear it, but the necessitous, and those that are accustomed to its strong fmoaky tang; yet it is much used in feme of the western parts of England. The fern-dried malt is al To attended with a rank disagreeable talle from the smoak of this vegetable. Of ^grinding Malts. Twts article\\' Well deserves the notice of all brewers, for on it the goodness of our drink greatly depends ; because, if it is ground too small, the flour of the malt will -be the easier and more freely mixed with the water, and will cause the wort to run thick; therefore the malt must be only just broke in the mill, to make it emit its spirit gradually, and incorporate its flour with the water in such a manner, that sir-st a stout beer, : then an ale, and afterwards a small beer may be had at one and the same brewing, and the wort run off fine and clear to the last. Many are likewise so sagacious as to grind \\' their brown malt a fortnight before they use it, and keep it in a dry place, that it may become mellower, by.losing in a great measure the.fury of its harlh fiery particles, and its steely nature, which this -sort of malt acquires on the kiln. However, this, as well as many other-hard bodies, may be reduced by time and air into a more soluble, mellow, and soft condition, and then it will imbibe the water, and give a natural kind tinfhire more, freely, by which a greater-quantity and stronger drink may be made than if it was used directly from the mill, and be much smoother and better tasted. But pale malts will be sit for use at a week’s end, because the leifureness of their drying endows them with a softness from the time they are taken off the kiln to the time they are brewed, and supplies in them what time and air must do in the brown sorts. This method of grinding malt so long beforehand cannot be so conveniently pratftifed by some of the great brewers, because several of them brew two or three times a week ; but now most of them grind their malts into the tun by the help of a long, descending, wooden spout; and here they save the charge of emptying or uncasing it out of the bin,-and also the waste of a great deal of the mhit-flour, that is lost when carried in balkets. A steel hand-mill, will, by the help of only one man, grind six or eight bushels in an hour, and will last a family many years without hardening or cutting. There are some old fashioned stone hand-mills in being, that some prefer to the iron ones, because they alledge that these break the corn’s body, when the iron ones only cut it in two, which occasions the malt, so broke by the stones, to give the water a more easy, free, and regular power to extrad its virtue, than the cut-malt can that is more confined within its hull. Notwithstanding, the iron ones are now mostly in use, for their great dispatch and long duration. In the country they frequently throw a sack of malt on a stone or brick floor as soon as it is ground, and let it lie, giving it one turn, for a day or two, that the stones or bricks may draw out the fiery quality it received from the kiln, and give the drink a soft mild taste. W I N G. Of the Nature of several Waters, and their Use in Brevsing. Water is a matter of great importance in brewing wholesome fine malt-liquors. Now, the more simple and freer every water is from foreign particles, it is the better. Spring-waters are in general liable to partake of those minerals through which they pass. At Uppingham in Rutland, their water is .said to come off an alem rock, and so. tinges their beer with its faline quality, that it is easily tasted at the first draught. But that which will lather with soap, or soft water, that percolates through chalk,, or a grey fire.-stone, is generally accounted.hest ; . for chalk in this refped excells all other earths, because it communicates nothing unwholesome. to the waters, but abforbs. any minerals that, may .accompany the water that runs through them : For which reason they throw, in great quantities of chalk into their wells at A Ueftmry to soften their water, which, coming off a black fandftone, is so hard and /harp, that it will often turn their beer four in a week’s time ; so that in its original state it is neither sit to walli nor brew with, but so long as the alcaline particles of the chalk hold good, they put it tq both uses. River-water is less liable to be loaded with metallic,* petrifying, or faline particles^ than the well or spring sorts, especially at some dillance from the spring head,, because the rain-water mixes with and. softens it. But in running, it often colleifts gross particles, from ou-zy muddy mixtures, particularly near town, which make the beer fubjed to new fermentations, and g?ow soul upon any alteration of the weather, as the ThameS-water. generally does ; yet this, for its softness, is much betten than the hard for t; however, both these waters are ufedby some brewers. But where river-water.can be had clear} in a dry time, when no great rain has lately fell out of rivulets, or rivers that have a gravelly, chalky, sandy,\\' or stony bottom, free from the disturbance of cattle, &c. and in good air, it may then justly claim the name of a most excellent water for brewing, and will make a stronger drink with the same quantity of malt than any of the well-waters; insomuch-that that of the Thames has been proved to make as strong beer with seven buftiels of malt, as well-water with eight; and so are all river-waters in a proportionable degree, arid, where they can be obtained clean and pure, drink may be drawn fine in a few days after tunning. Rain-water is very soft, of a most simple and pure nature, and the best diluter of any, especially if received free from dirt and mortar that often mix with it as it runs off tiled rooss; this is very agreeable for brewing of ales that are not to be kept long, but for beers that are to remain some time in the calks, it is not so good, being apt to putrify the soonest of any. Pond waters. This includes all.standing waters, chief-; ly from rain, and are good or bad according to circumfiances; for where there is a clean bottom, and the wa-. ter lies undisturbed from the tread of cattle, or too many filh, in an open found air, in a large quantity, and wherethe sun has free access, it is then nearly as good as rain or river-waters. But where it is in a small quantity, or full of si(h (especially the fling-tench) or is so disturbed by cattle, as to force up mud and filth, it is then the most soul and disagreeable of all others : So is it likewise in long dry seasons, when our pond-waters are so low as to oblige us to drain it through fieves before we can use it, to take out the small red worms and other corruptions that stagnant waters are fubjeft to. The London Method of Brewing. Stout Butt leer or Porter. Th i s is the ftrongefl: porter that is brewed from brown malt, and often sold for forty (hillings the barrel, or six pounds the butt out of the wholesale cellars : The liquor (for it is six-pence forfeit in the London brewhoufe if the word water is named) in the copper designed for the first mafli, has a two-bu(hel basket, or more, of the mod hully malt thrown over it, to cover its top, and afterwards its boiling; this mud be made very hot, almod ready to boil, yet not so as to blifler, for then it will be in too high heat; but, as an indication of this, tire soul part of the liquor will ascend, and the malt swell up, and then it mud be parted, looked into, and felt with the finger or back of the hand, and if the liquor be clear, and of such heat as can be but jufl endured, it is then enough, and the doker mud damp his fire as soon as poflible, by throwing in a good parcel of freftr coals, .and (hutting his iron vent-doors ; immediately on this, they let as much cold liquor or water run into the copper as will make it all of a heat, somewhat more than blood-warm; this they pump over, or let it pass by a cock into an upright wooden square (pout or trunk, and it directly rises thtough the holes of a false bottom into the malt, which is worked by several men with oars for about half an hour, and is called the fird and dif Fmafli: While this is doing, there is more liquor heating in the copper, that mud not be let into the mafh-tun till it is very (harp, almod ready to boil; with this they mafli again, then cover it with several bafltets of malt, and let it (land an hour before it runs into the under back, which, when boiled an hour and a half with a good quantity of hops, makes this (lout. The next is maflied with a cooler liquor, then a (harper, and the next blood-warm or quite cold; by which alternate degrees of heat, a quantity of small beer is made after the dout. To make Porter, or Butt-beer, to have a fine Tang. This, of late, has been improved two ways : Fird, by mixing two bushels of pale malt with six of brown, which will preserve butt-beer in a mellow condition, and cause it to have a pleasant sweet flavour: Aijd, secondly, further to improve and render it more palatable, they boil it two hours and a half, and work it two days as cold as poflible-in the tun ; at lad, they dir it, and put a good handful of common fait into the quantity of a butt: Then, when the yead has had one rifihg more, \\' Strong Brown Ale, called Stitch. Most of this is the fird running of the malt, but yet Von. I. Numb. 28. of a longer length than is drawn from the flout; it has but few hops boiled in it, and is (old for eight-pence per gallon at the brew-house out of the tun, and is generally made to amend the common brown ale with, on particu Common Brown Ale and Starting-beer. They take the liquors from the brown ale as for the dout, but draw a greater quantity from the malt than for dout or ditch ; and after the dif F and second malh, they cap the goods with frelh malt, to keep in the (pint, and boil it an hour; after this, small beer is made of the same goods. Thus also the common brown darting buttbeer or porter is brewed, only boiled with more hops an hour and a half, and worked cooler and longer than the brown ale, and a shorter length drawn from the mair. But it is cudomary after the brown ale, or when a quantity of small beer is wanted, or is to be brewed better than ordinary, to put so much, frelh malt on the goods as will answer that purpose. Pale and Amber Ales and Beer. As the brown malts are brewed with river, these are brewed with well or spring-Iiquors. The liquors are by forne taken (harper for pale than brown malts, and, after the fird scalding liquor is put over, some lower the red by degrees, to the lad, which is quite cold, for their small beer; aqd for butt-beers, there is no other differ rence than the addition of more hops, and boiling, and the method of working. Entire Guile Small Beer, On the fird liquor they throw some hully malt,, to drew the break of it, and when it is very (harp, they let in some cold liquor, and run it into the tun milk-warm; this is malhed with thirty or forty pulls of the oar, and let dand till the second liquor is ready, which mud be almod fclalding hot to the back of the hand ; then run it by the cock into the tun, mafh it up, and let it dand an hour before it is spent off into the under-back: These two pieces of liquor will make one copper of the fird wort, without putting any frefli malt on the goods ; the next liquor to be blood-warm, the next (harp, and the next cool or cold ; for the general way in great brew-houses is, to let a cool liquor precede a (harp one, because it gradually opens the pores of the malt and.goods, and prepares the way for the hotter liquor that is to fol The several Lengths or Quantities of Drinks that have been made from Malt, and their several Prices, as they have been sold at a common Brew-house.

For flitch or drong brown ale, one bar-, rel and a firkin, at one and twenty (hillings and four pence per barrel from the tun.

But where river-water.can be had clear} in a dry time, when no great rain has lately fell out of rivulets, or rivers that have a gravelly, chalky, sandy,\\' or stony bottom, free from the disturbance of cattle, &c. and in good air, it may then justly claim the name of a most excellent water for brewing, and will make a stronger drink with the same quantity of malt than any of the well-waters; insomuch-that that of the Thames has been proved to make as strong beer with seven buftiels of malt, as well-water with eight; and so are all river-waters in a proportionable degree, arid, where they can be obtained clean and pure, drink may be drawn fine in a few days after tunning. Rain-water is very soft, of a most simple and pure nature, and the best diluter of any, especially if received free from dirt and mortar that often mix with it as it runs off tiled rooss; this is very agreeable for brewing of ales that are not to be kept long, but for beers that are to remain some time in the calks, it is not so good, being apt to putrify the soonest of any. Pond waters. This includes all.standing waters, chief-; ly from rain, and are good or bad according to circumfiances; for where there is a clean bottom, and the wa-. ter lies undisturbed from the tread of cattle, or too many filh, in an open found air, in a large quantity, and wherethe sun has free access, it is then nearly as good as rain or river-waters. But where it is in a small quantity, or full of si(h (especially the fling-tench) or is so disturbed by cattle, as to force up mud and filth, it is then the most soul and disagreeable of all others : So is it likewise in long dry seasons, when our pond-waters are so low as to oblige us to drain it through fieves before we can use it, to take out the small red worms and other corruptions that stagnant waters are fubjeft to. The London Method of Brewing. Stout Butt leer or Porter. Th i s is the ftrongefl: porter that is brewed from brown malt, and often sold for forty (hillings the barrel, or six pounds the butt out of the wholesale cellars : The liquor (for it is six-pence forfeit in the London brewhoufe if the word water is named) in the copper designed for the first mafli, has a two-bu(hel basket, or more, of the mod hully malt thrown over it, to cover its top, and afterwards its boiling; this mud be made very hot, almod ready to boil, yet not so as to blifler, for then it will be in too high heat; but, as an indication of this, tire soul part of the liquor will ascend, and the malt swell up, and then it mud be parted, looked into, and felt with the finger or back of the hand, and if the liquor be clear, and of such heat as can be but jufl endured, it is then enough, and the doker mud damp his fire as soon as poflible, by throwing in a good parcel of freftr coals, .and (hutting his iron vent-doors ; immediately on this, they let as much cold liquor or water run into the copper as will make it all of a heat, somewhat more than blood-warm; this they pump over, or let it pass by a cock into an upright wooden square (pout or trunk, and it directly rises thtough the holes of a false bottom into the malt, which is worked by several men with oars for about half an hour, and is called the fird and dif Fmafli: While this is doing, there is more liquor heating in the copper, that mud not be let into the mafh-tun till it is very (harp, almod ready to boil; with this they mafli again, then cover it with several bafltets of malt, and let it (land an hour before it runs into the under back, which, when boiled an hour and a half with a good quantity of hops, makes this (lout. The next is maflied with a cooler liquor, then a (harper, and the next blood-warm or quite cold; by which alternate degrees of heat, a quantity of small beer is made after the dout. To make Porter, or Butt-beer, to have a fine Tang. This, of late, has been improved two ways : Fird, by mixing two bushels of pale malt with six of brown, which will preserve butt-beer in a mellow condition, and cause it to have a pleasant sweet flavour: Aijd, secondly, further to improve and render it more palatable, they boil it two hours and a half, and work it two days as cold as poflible-in the tun ; at lad, they dir it, and put a good handful of common fait into the quantity of a butt: Then, when the yead has had one rifihg more, \\' Strong Brown Ale, called Stitch. Most of this is the fird running of the malt, but yet Von. I. Numb. 28. of a longer length than is drawn from the flout; it has but few hops boiled in it, and is (old for eight-pence per gallon at the brew-house out of the tun, and is generally made to amend the common brown ale with, on particu Common Brown Ale and Starting-beer. They take the liquors from the brown ale as for the dout, but draw a greater quantity from the malt than for dout or ditch ; and after the dif F and second malh, they cap the goods with frelh malt, to keep in the (pint, and boil it an hour; after this, small beer is made of the same goods. Thus also the common brown darting buttbeer or porter is brewed, only boiled with more hops an hour and a half, and worked cooler and longer than the brown ale, and a shorter length drawn from the mair. But it is cudomary after the brown ale, or when a quantity of small beer is wanted, or is to be brewed better than ordinary, to put so much, frelh malt on the goods as will answer that purpose. Pale and Amber Ales and Beer. As the brown malts are brewed with river, these are brewed with well or spring-Iiquors. The liquors are by forne taken (harper for pale than brown malts, and, after the fird scalding liquor is put over, some lower the red by degrees, to the lad, which is quite cold, for their small beer; aqd for butt-beers, there is no other differ rence than the addition of more hops, and boiling, and the method of working. Entire Guile Small Beer, On the fird liquor they throw some hully malt,, to drew the break of it, and when it is very (harp, they let in some cold liquor, and run it into the tun milk-warm; this is malhed with thirty or forty pulls of the oar, and let dand till the second liquor is ready, which mud be almod fclalding hot to the back of the hand ; then run it by the cock into the tun, mafh it up, and let it dand an hour before it is spent off into the under-back: These two pieces of liquor will make one copper of the fird wort, without putting any frefli malt on the goods ; the next liquor to be blood-warm, the next (harp, and the next cool or cold ; for the general way in great brew-houses is, to let a cool liquor precede a (harp one, because it gradually opens the pores of the malt and.goods, and prepares the way for the hotter liquor that is to fol The several Lengths or Quantities of Drinks that have been made from Malt, and their several Prices, as they have been sold at a common Brew-house.

His copper holds twenty-four gallons, and the mafhlub has room enough for four or more bulhels of malt. The first full copper of boiling water he puts into the mafh-tub, there to lie a quarter of an hour, till the ffeam is so far spent that he can see his face in it; or, as soon as the hot water is put in, throws a pail or two of cold water into it, which will bring it at once into a temper ; then he lets three bulhels of malt be run leisurely into it, and stirred or malhed all the while, but as little as can be, or no more than just to keep the malt from clotting or balling; when that is done, he puts one bushel of dry malt at th<i top, to keep in the vapour or spirit, and so lets if stand covered two hours, or till the neat copper-full of water is boiling hot, which he lades over the malt or goods three hand-bowls full at a time, that are to run off at the cock or tap by a very small st ream before more is put on, which again must be returned into the mafti tub till it comes off exceeding fine ;■ for, u\\' nless the wort is clear when it goes into the copper, there are little hopes it will be so in the barrel ; which leisure way obliges him to be sixteen hours in brewing these four buffels of malt. Now between the ladings-over he puts cold warer into the copper so be boiling hot, while the other is running off; by this means hi <; copper is kept up near full, and the cock spending to the end of brewing his ale or small beer, of which only twenty-one gallons must be saved of the first wort that is reserved in a tub, wherein four ounces of hops are put, and then it is to be set by. For the second wort we will suppose there are twenty gallons of water in the copper boiling hot, that must be all laded over in the same manner as the former was, but no cold water need here be mixed ; when half of this is run out into a tub, it must be diredly put into the copper with half of the first wort, strained through the brewing-sieve as it lies on a final! wooden i\\' oose frame over the copper, to keep back those hops that were first put in to, preserve it, which is to make the first copper twenty-one gallons ; then, upon its beginning to boil, he puts in a pound of hops in one or two canvas qr other\\' coarse linen bags, somewhat larger thanwi^att.\\'contain the hops, that an allowance may be giv^^Mpi their swell; this he boist away very briikly for-fij^p S\\' hour, when he takes the hops out and contincts Toiftfig the wort by itself till it breaks into particles-.flu tie ragged, and then it is enough, and must be difperted’-ihto the cooling-tubs very thin : Then put the remainder of the first and second wort together, and boil that the-same time, in the same manner, and with-the /abie quantity of frelh hops, as the first was. The rest 6f the third or small-beer wort will be about fifteen or twentv gallons more or less, which he mixes diredly with some cold water to keep it free of excife,. and puts it into the copper as the first liquor to begin a second brewing of ale, with another four bu/hels of malt as he did before, and so on for several days together if necessary ; and at last there may be some small-beer made. The Nature and Use of the Hop. This vegetable was formerly thought-to be an unw I N G. wholesome ingredient. Indeed, when the hop, in a dear time, is adulterated with water, in which aloes, ©r. have been infused, in order to make the old hops recover their bitterness, and seem new, then they are to be looked on as unwholesome; but the pure new hop, when properly managed, has no hurtful qualities. But if the hops are boiled in strong or small worts beyond their fine and pure nature, the liquor suffers, and will be tanged with a noxious taste, both ungrateful and unwholesome to the stomach; and, if boiled to a very great excess, they will be apt to cause teachings. . It is for these realons that we advise the boiling tv/o parcels of frelh hops in each copper of ale-wort; and, if there were three for keeping beer, it would be so much the better for the taste, health, of body, and longer preservation of the beer in a found smooth condition. For this purpose, some make a bag, like a pillowber, and boil the hops in it half an hour; then take them out, and put in another bag of the like quantity of frefti hops, and boil them half an hour more ; by which means there is an opportunity of boiling both wort and hops a due time, saving the trouble of straining them through a sieve, and securing the feeds of the hops at the same time from mixing with the drink; afterwards they boil the same bags in the small beer, till the substance of it is got out; but observe that the bags be made larger than what would just contain the hops, otherwise it will be difficult to boil out their substance. It is true, that here is a charge increased by the consumption of a greater quantity of hops than usual; but then how greatly will they answer the desired end of enjoying fine-palated wholesome drink, that, in a cheap time, will not amount to much, if bought at the best hand; and, if we consider their after-use and benefit in small beer, there is not any loss at all in their quantity: But, where it can be afforded, the very small beer would be much improved if freffi hops were also shifted in the boiling of this as well as the stronger worts. Hence may appear the hardships that many are under of being necessitated to drink of those brewers malt-Kquors, who, out of avarice, boil their hops to the last, that they may not lose any of their quintessence. After the wort is cooled and put into the working-vat or tub. some throw fresh hops into it, and work them with the yeast, at the same time reserving a few gallons of raw wort to wash the yeast through a sieve to keep back the hop. This is a good way where enough of hops have not been sufficiently boiled in the wort, or to pre* serve it in the coolers where it is laid thick. When hops are dear, many use the feeds of wormwood instead of them: Others use the daucus or wild* carrot feed that grows in our common fields, which many of the poor people gather 1 and dry in their houses f for the purpose of selling them to the brewers : Others use borer hound, which indeed is a fine bitter, and grows on several of our commons. Hops have a fine grateful bitter, which makes the drink easy of digestion; they also keep it from running into such cohefions as would make it ropy, vapid, and four; and therefore are not only of great use in boiled,. but in raw. worts, to preserve them found till they can be putMethod praftifed hy a Victualler, for Brewing Ale or October Beer, from NettIngham.

Here then it must be observed, that the earthy part of the hop is the cause of that rough, harsh, unpleasant tafle which accompany both ales and beers that have the hops so long boiled in them, as to tin&ure their worts with their mischievous esse&s; for, notwithstanding the malt be ever so good, the hops, if boiled too long in them,, will be so predominant as to cause a bad taste. Of boiling Malt-liquors. Althou’Gh it has been formerly said, that an hour and a half is requisite for boiling of Oftober beer, and an hour for ales and small beer ; yet it is to be observed, that an exadt time is not altogether a certain rule in this case , for, when loose hops are boiled in the wort so long till they all sink, their feeds will arise and fall down again ; the wort also will be curdled, and broken into small particles if examined in a hand-bowl, but afterwards into larger, as big as great pins heads, and will appear clean and fine at the top. This is so much a rule with some, that they regard\\' not time, but this Sign, to shew when the wort is boiled enough ; and this will happen sooner or later, according to the nature of tbej>arley, and its being well malted; for, if it comes off chalks or gravels, it generally has the good property of breaking or curdling Soon; but, if off tough clays, then it is longer, which, by some persons, is not a little va hied, because it saves time in boiling, and consequently the consumption of the wort. It is also to be observed, that pale malt-worts will not break so soon in the copper as the brown sorts; but, when either of their worts boil, it ftiould be to the purpose, for then they will break, sooner, and Waste less, than if they are kept fimmering, . and will likewise work more kindly in the tun, drink smoother,. and keep longer. Now all malt-worts may be spoiled by too little or too much boiling: If too little, then the drink will.always tafie raw, mawkifh, and be unwholesome in the flomach, where, instead of helping to dilute, and digest our food, it will cause obllrudions, cholics, head-achs,. and other diseases: Besides,-all such under-boiled drinks are cer^tainly exposed to ftaleness and fourness, much sooner than those that have had their full time in the copper. And if they are boiled too long, they will then thicken and nbt come out of the copper line and in a right condition. which will cause it never to be right clear in the barrel. But to be more particular, no ale-wdrts, boiled less than an hour, can be good; because, in an hour’s time, they cannot acquire a thickness of body any ways detrimental to them; and, in less than an hour, the ramous vifcid parts of the ale cannot be fufhciently broke and divided, so as to prevent its running.into cohefions, ropir ness, and fourness; because in ales there are .not hopsenough allowed to do this, which good boiling must in a great measure supply,-or else such drink can never be good; for then its cohefive parts being not thoroughly broke and comminuted by time and boiling, remain hard. I N G. 671 and in a good measure indigestible in the stomach : How ignorant then are those people, who, in tippling of such liquor, can praise it for excellent good ale, only because its taste is fweetifh, (which is the nature of such raw drinks)^ believing it to be the pure effedt of the genuine malt, and not perceiving the brewer’s avarice and cunning, to save the consumption of his wort by shortness of boiling, tho’ to the great prejudice of the drinker’s health ? In boiling, both time and the curdling or breaking of the wort should be consulted ; for if a person was to boil the wort an hour, and then take it out of the copper before it was rightly broke, it would be wrong management, and the drink would not be fine and wholesome; and if it Ihould boil an hour and a half, or two hours, without regarding when its particles are in a right order, then it may be too thick; so that due care must be had to the two extremes, to obtain it in its due order; therefore, in Odtober and keeping beers, an hour and a quarter’s good boiling is commonly sufficient to have a thorough cured drink; for generally in that time it will break and boil enough ; because in this there is a double security by length of boiling, and a quantity of hops shifted ; but in the new way there is only a single one, and that is by a double or treble allowance of fresh hops boiled only half an hour in the wort; and for this practice a reason is afligned, that the hops, being endowed with difeutient apertive qualities, will, by them and their great quantity, supply the defedt of underboiling the wort; and that a farther conveniency is here enjoyed by having only the fine, wholesome, strong, floury, fpirituous parts of the hop in the drink, exclufiye of the phlegmetic, earthy parts which would be extradhed, if the hops were to be boiled above half an hour; and therefore there are many now that are so attached to this new method, that they will not brew ale or beer any other way, thinking, that if hops are boiled above thirty minutes, the wort will exhibit some of their bad qualities. The allowance of hops for ale or beer cannot be exadfly adjusted without coming to particulars, because the proportion should be according to the nature and quality of the male, the feafomof the year it is brewed in, and the length of time it is to be kept. For strong brown ale brewed in-ally-of the winter^ months, and boiled an hour, one pound “is but barely sufficient for a hogffiead, if it be tapped in three weeks or a month. If for pale aie brewed at that time, and for that age; one pound and a quarter pf hops; but if these ales are brewed in any of the .summer months, there ihould be more hops-allowed i For Odlober or March brown beer, a hogffiead made; from eleven buffiels of malt, boiled an hour and a quarter, to be kept nine months, three pounds and a half ought to be boiled in such drink at the Jeaft. For O&ober or March pale beer, made from fourteen buffiels, boiled,an hour and a quarter, and kept twelve months, six pounds ought to be allowed to a hogshead of luch drink, and more if the Imps are flufted in two bags, and less time given the wort to baiL. OfOf Foxing or Fainting Malt-Liquors. Foxing,is a misfortune, or rather a disease, in maltdrinks, occasioned by divers means, as the nastiness of the utensils, putting the worts too thick together in the backs or coolers, brewing toooften and soon one after another, and sometimes by bad malts and waters, and the liquors taken in wrong heats, being of such pernicious consequence to the great brewer in particular, that he sometimes cannot recover and bring his matters into a right order again in less than a week or two, and is so hateful to him in its very name, that it is a general law among them to make all servants that name the word Fox or Foxing in the brew-house to pay six-pence, which obliges them to call it Reynard; for, when once the drink is tainted, it may be smelt at Ibme difiance somewhat like a Fox: It chiefly happens in hot weather, and causes the beer and ale so tainted to acquire a fulsome fickilh tafie, that will, if it is received in a great degree, become ropy like treacle, and in Tome fliort time turn i\\\\nd here we ihall mention the great value of the hop in preventing and curing the fox in malt-liquors. When the wort is run into the tub out of the maihing-vat, it is a very good way to throw feme hops diredliy into it before it is put into the copper, and they will secure it against fourness and ropinels, that are the two effedts of foxed worts or dfinks, and are of such power in this refpedt, that raw worts may be Icept some time, even in hot weather, before they are boiled, and which is neceflary where there is a large quantity of malt used to a little copper; but it is certain that the stronger worts will keep longer with hops than the smaller sorts: So likewise, if a person has fewer tubs than are wanted, and he is apprehensive his worts will be foxed by too thick lying in the coolers or working tubs, then it will be a safe way to put some fresh hops into such tubs, and work them with the yeafi, or, in case the drink is already foxed in the vat or tun, new hops should be put in and worked with it, and they will greatly fetch it again into a right order; but then such drink fliould be carefully taken clear off from its gross nasty lee, which being mostly tainted, would otherwise lie in the barrel, corrupt, and make it worse. Some list quick-lime into foxed drinks while they are working in the tun or vat, that its fire and fait may break the cohefions of the beer or ale, and burn away the stench that the corruption would always cause; but then such drink should by a peg at the bottom of the vat be drawn off as fine as poflible, and the dregs left Of fermenting and ■working of Beers and Ales. Though a frnall quantity of yeafi be necessary to ferment and fine the wort; yet it is in itself of a poison T ous nature, and if beat into the wort too often or in too large a quantity, by its ftupifying and narcotic quality, it makes the liquor so heady, that five bushels of malt may be equal in strength to six. But liquor made in this manner is extremely unwholfome. It is alledged indeed, that beating the yeafi into worl gives it a fine relish, or it makes the ale bite of theyeaft J but the true reason is, to further its sale, on account of its intoxicating quality. But some people are so fond of white thick ale, that they often kill themfejves by drinking it; nor is their humour much different as to the com-i mon brewers brown ale, who, when the customer wants a hogshead, they put in immediately a handful of fait, and another of flour, and so bring it up ; this is no soon^ er on the Hilling than it is tapped, that it may carry a froth on the top of the pot, otherwise they despise it. Of working and fermenting London Stout Beer and Ale. The yeast is at once put into the tun to work the fiout-beer and ale with ; by this means, and the shortness of time we have to ferment our firong drinks, we cannot make reserves of cold worts to mix with and check the too forward working of those liquors. The strong beer brewed for keeping is suffered to be blood-warm in the winter, when the yeast is put into it, that it may gradually work two nights and a day at least, for this will not admit of such a hafiy operation .as the common brown ale, because, if it is worked too warm and baity, such beer will not ke«p near so long as that fermented cooler. The brown ale has, indeed, its yeast put into it in the evening very warm, because it is often carried away the vety next morning. The pale or amber ales are often kept near it, not quite a week under fermentation, for the better incorporating the yeafi with the Of forwarding and retarding the Fermentation of Malt In case beer or ale is backward in working, it is customary to call some flour out of the dusting-box, of with the hand, over the top of the drink, which will become a sort of crust or cover to help to keep the cold out: Others put in one or two ounces of powdered ginger, which heats the wort and brings it forward : Others take a gallon stone-bottle and fill it with boiling water, which, being well corked, is put into the working tub, where it communicates a gradual \\' heat for some time, and forwards the fermentation: Others reserve some raw wort, which they heat and mix with the rest; but then care must be taken, that the pot in which it is heated has no manner of grease about it, left it should impede; instead of promoting the working; but, for retarding and keeping back any drink that is too much heated in working, the cold raw wort is the most proper of any thing to check it; though some are known to put one or more pewter diihes into it for that purpose; or, it maybe broke into several other tubs, where, by its ftiallow lying, its fury will be abated. Others again, to make drink work that is backward, will take the whites of two eggs, and beat them up with half a quartern of good brandy, and put it either into the working-vat, or into the calk, which will quickly bring it forward, if a warm cloth is put over the bung. Others tie up bran in a coarse thin cloth, and put it into the vat, where, by its spongy nature, it abforbs a quantity of the drink, and breeds a heat to forward its working.put into the copper, and afterwards in the tun, while the drink is working. Here then it must be observed, that the earthy part of the hop is the cause of that rough, harsh, unpleasant tafle which accompany both ales and beers that have the hops so long boiled in them, as to tin&ure their worts with their mischievous esse&s; for, notwithstanding the malt be ever so good, the hops, if boiled too long in them,, will be so predominant as to cause a bad taste. Of boiling Malt-liquors. Althou’Gh it has been formerly said, that an hour and a half is requisite for boiling of Oftober beer, and an hour for ales and small beer ; yet it is to be observed, that an exadt time is not altogether a certain rule in this case , for, when loose hops are boiled in the wort so long till they all sink, their feeds will arise and fall down again ; the wort also will be curdled, and broken into small particles if examined in a hand-bowl, but afterwards into larger, as big as great pins heads, and will appear clean and fine at the top. This is so much a rule with some, that they regard\\' not time, but this Sign, to shew when the wort is boiled enough ; and this will happen sooner or later, according to the nature of tbej>arley, and its being well malted; for, if it comes off chalks or gravels, it generally has the good property of breaking or curdling Soon; but, if off tough clays, then it is longer, which, by some persons, is not a little va hied, because it saves time in boiling, and consequently the consumption of the wort. It is also to be observed, that pale malt-worts will not break so soon in the copper as the brown sorts; but, when either of their worts boil, it ftiould be to the purpose, for then they will break, sooner, and Waste less, than if they are kept fimmering, . and will likewise work more kindly in the tun, drink smoother,. and keep longer. Now all malt-worts may be spoiled by too little or too much boiling: If too little, then the drink will.always tafie raw, mawkifh, and be unwholesome in the flomach, where, instead of helping to dilute, and digest our food, it will cause obllrudions, cholics, head-achs,. and other diseases: Besides,-all such under-boiled drinks are cer^tainly exposed to ftaleness and fourness, much sooner than those that have had their full time in the copper. And if they are boiled too long, they will then thicken and nbt come out of the copper line and in a right condition. which will cause it never to be right clear in the barrel. But to be more particular, no ale-wdrts, boiled less than an hour, can be good; because, in an hour’s time, they cannot acquire a thickness of body any ways detrimental to them; and, in less than an hour, the ramous vifcid parts of the ale cannot be fufhciently broke and divided, so as to prevent its running.into cohefions, ropir ness, and fourness; because in ales there are .not hopsenough allowed to do this, which good boiling must in a great measure supply,-or else such drink can never be good; for then its cohefive parts being not thoroughly broke and comminuted by time and boiling, remain hard. I N G. 671 and in a good measure indigestible in the stomach : How ignorant then are those people, who, in tippling of such liquor, can praise it for excellent good ale, only because its taste is fweetifh, (which is the nature of such raw drinks)^ believing it to be the pure effedt of the genuine malt, and not perceiving the brewer’s avarice and cunning, to save the consumption of his wort by shortness of boiling, tho’ to the great prejudice of the drinker’s health ? In boiling, both time and the curdling or breaking of the wort should be consulted ; for if a person was to boil the wort an hour, and then take it out of the copper before it was rightly broke, it would be wrong management, and the drink would not be fine and wholesome; and if it Ihould boil an hour and a half, or two hours, without regarding when its particles are in a right order, then it may be too thick; so that due care must be had to the two extremes, to obtain it in its due order; therefore, in Odtober and keeping beers, an hour and a quarter’s good boiling is commonly sufficient to have a thorough cured drink; for generally in that time it will break and boil enough ; because in this there is a double security by length of boiling, and a quantity of hops shifted ; but in the new way there is only a single one, and that is by a double or treble allowance of fresh hops boiled only half an hour in the wort; and for this practice a reason is afligned, that the hops, being endowed with difeutient apertive qualities, will, by them and their great quantity, supply the defedt of underboiling the wort; and that a farther conveniency is here enjoyed by having only the fine, wholesome, strong, floury, fpirituous parts of the hop in the drink, exclufiye of the phlegmetic, earthy parts which would be extradhed, if the hops were to be boiled above half an hour; and therefore there are many now that are so attached to this new method, that they will not brew ale or beer any other way, thinking, that if hops are boiled above thirty minutes, the wort will exhibit some of their bad qualities. The allowance of hops for ale or beer cannot be exadfly adjusted without coming to particulars, because the proportion should be according to the nature and quality of the male, the feafomof the year it is brewed in, and the length of time it is to be kept. For strong brown ale brewed in-ally-of the winter^ months, and boiled an hour, one pound “is but barely sufficient for a hogffiead, if it be tapped in three weeks or a month. If for pale aie brewed at that time, and for that age; one pound and a quarter pf hops; but if these ales are brewed in any of the .summer months, there ihould be more hops-allowed i For Odlober or March brown beer, a hogffiead made; from eleven buffiels of malt, boiled an hour and a quarter, to be kept nine months, three pounds and a half ought to be boiled in such drink at the Jeaft. For O&ober or March pale beer, made from fourteen buffiels, boiled,an hour and a quarter, and kept twelve months, six pounds ought to be allowed to a hogshead of luch drink, and more if the Imps are flufted in two bags, and less time given the wort to baiL. OfOf Foxing or Fainting Malt-Liquors. Foxing,is a misfortune, or rather a disease, in maltdrinks, occasioned by divers means, as the nastiness of the utensils, putting the worts too thick together in the backs or coolers, brewing toooften and soon one after another, and sometimes by bad malts and waters, and the liquors taken in wrong heats, being of such pernicious consequence to the great brewer in particular, that he sometimes cannot recover and bring his matters into a right order again in less than a week or two, and is so hateful to him in its very name, that it is a general law among them to make all servants that name the word Fox or Foxing in the brew-house to pay six-pence, which obliges them to call it Reynard; for, when once the drink is tainted, it may be smelt at Ibme difiance somewhat like a Fox: It chiefly happens in hot weather, and causes the beer and ale so tainted to acquire a fulsome fickilh tafie, that will, if it is received in a great degree, become ropy like treacle, and in Tome fliort time turn i\\\\nd here we ihall mention the great value of the hop in preventing and curing the fox in malt-liquors. When the wort is run into the tub out of the maihing-vat, it is a very good way to throw feme hops diredliy into it before it is put into the copper, and they will secure it against fourness and ropinels, that are the two effedts of foxed worts or dfinks, and are of such power in this refpedt, that raw worts may be Icept some time, even in hot weather, before they are boiled, and which is neceflary where there is a large quantity of malt used to a little copper; but it is certain that the stronger worts will keep longer with hops than the smaller sorts: So likewise, if a person has fewer tubs than are wanted, and he is apprehensive his worts will be foxed by too thick lying in the coolers or working tubs, then it will be a safe way to put some fresh hops into such tubs, and work them with the yeafi, or, in case the drink is already foxed in the vat or tun, new hops should be put in and worked with it, and they will greatly fetch it again into a right order; but then such drink fliould be carefully taken clear off from its gross nasty lee, which being mostly tainted, would otherwise lie in the barrel, corrupt, and make it worse. Some list quick-lime into foxed drinks while they are working in the tun or vat, that its fire and fait may break the cohefions of the beer or ale, and burn away the stench that the corruption would always cause; but then such drink should by a peg at the bottom of the vat be drawn off as fine as poflible, and the dregs left Of fermenting and ■working of Beers and Ales. Though a frnall quantity of yeafi be necessary to ferment and fine the wort; yet it is in itself of a poison T ous nature, and if beat into the wort too often or in too large a quantity, by its ftupifying and narcotic quality, it makes the liquor so heady, that five bushels of malt may be equal in strength to six. But liquor made in this manner is extremely unwholfome. It is alledged indeed, that beating the yeafi into worl gives it a fine relish, or it makes the ale bite of theyeaft J but the true reason is, to further its sale, on account of its intoxicating quality. But some people are so fond of white thick ale, that they often kill themfejves by drinking it; nor is their humour much different as to the com-i mon brewers brown ale, who, when the customer wants a hogshead, they put in immediately a handful of fait, and another of flour, and so bring it up ; this is no soon^ er on the Hilling than it is tapped, that it may carry a froth on the top of the pot, otherwise they despise it. Of working and fermenting London Stout Beer and Ale. The yeast is at once put into the tun to work the fiout-beer and ale with ; by this means, and the shortness of time we have to ferment our firong drinks, we cannot make reserves of cold worts to mix with and check the too forward working of those liquors. The strong beer brewed for keeping is suffered to be blood-warm in the winter, when the yeast is put into it, that it may gradually work two nights and a day at least, for this will not admit of such a hafiy operation .as the common brown ale, because, if it is worked too warm and baity, such beer will not ke«p near so long as that fermented cooler. The brown ale has, indeed, its yeast put into it in the evening very warm, because it is often carried away the vety next morning. The pale or amber ales are often kept near it, not quite a week under fermentation, for the better incorporating the yeafi with the Of forwarding and retarding the Fermentation of Malt In case beer or ale is backward in working, it is customary to call some flour out of the dusting-box, of with the hand, over the top of the drink, which will become a sort of crust or cover to help to keep the cold out: Others put in one or two ounces of powdered ginger, which heats the wort and brings it forward : Others take a gallon stone-bottle and fill it with boiling water, which, being well corked, is put into the working tub, where it communicates a gradual \\' heat for some time, and forwards the fermentation: Others reserve some raw wort, which they heat and mix with the rest; but then care must be taken, that the pot in which it is heated has no manner of grease about it, left it should impede; instead of promoting the working; but, for retarding and keeping back any drink that is too much heated in working, the cold raw wort is the most proper of any thing to check it; though some are known to put one or more pewter diihes into it for that purpose; or, it maybe broke into several other tubs, where, by its ftiallow lying, its fury will be abated. Others again, to make drink work that is backward, will take the whites of two eggs, and beat them up with half a quartern of good brandy, and put it either into the working-vat, or into the calk, which will quickly bring it forward, if a warm cloth is put over the bung.

This is very right, in ales that are to be drank soon ; but in beers, that are to lie nine or twelve months in a butt or other calk, there certainly will be wanted some faces or fedim\\' ents for the beer to feed on, else it must consequently grow hungry, fliarp, and eager; and therefore, if its own top or bottom are not put into a calk with the beer, some other artificial composition, or lee, Ihould supply its place, that is wholesomer, and will better feed with such drink, than its own natural settlement; and therefore, there are here inserted several receipts for answering this end. Of artificial Lees for Stout or Stale Beer to . feed on. This article is of very great importance in the curing of our malt-liquors. The general, misfortune of the porter or keeping-beers drinking hard and harlh, is partly owing to the hasty soul feces that lie at the bottom of the calk, compounded of the fediments of malt, hops, and yealt. Wheat is, by many, put into such beer to feed and preserve it, as being reckoned a substantial alcali; however, it has been proved, that such wheat in about three years time has eat into the very wood of the calk. Others hang a bag of wheat in the vessel, that it may not touch the bottom; but, in both cases, the wheat is discovered to absorb and collect the acid qualities of the beer, yeast, and hop. Hence it is, that such whole wheat is loaded with the qualities of the unwholesome fettlernents or grounds of the beer, and becomes of such a corroding nature, as to do mischief; and, for that reason, some hang a bag of the flour of malted oats, wheat, pease, or beans, in the veflels of beer, as being of a lighter and mellower body than the whole wheat or its flour, -and more natural to the liquor: But whether it be raw wheat or malted, it is supposed, after this re? ceptacle has emitted its alcalous properties to the beer, and taken in all it can of the acid qualities thereof, that such beer will in time prey upon that again, and so communicate its pernicious qualities to the liquor. Composition for feeding Porter or Keeping-Beers. Take a quart of French brandy, or as much of Englilh, that is free from any burnt tang, or other ill taste, and is full proof; to this put as much wheat\\' or beanflour as will knead it into dough, put it in long pieces ‘into the bung-hole, as soon as the beer has done working, or aftorwards, and let it gently fall piece by piece to the bottom of the butt ; this will maintain the diink in a mellow frelhness, keep ftaleness off for some time, and cause it to be the flronger as it grows aged.

Take one pound of treacle, or honey, one pound of the powder of dried oyster-lhells, .or sat chalk, mix them well, and put it into a butt, as soon as it has done working, or some time after, and bung it well; this will both fine and preserve the beer in a soft, smooth condition for a great while.

Of the Cellar or Repofitory for keeping Beers and Ales. It is\\' certain, that the weather has not only a power or influence in brewing, but also after, die drink is in. the barrel, hoglhead, or butt, in cellars, or other places, which is often the cause of forwarding or retarding the fineness of malt-liquors; fur if we brew in cold weather, and the drink is to stand in a cellar of clay, or where springs. rise, or waters lie or pass through fucb a place, tliefe will check the due course of .the ch ink, chill, flat, deaden, and hinder it irom becoming fine. So like wife, if beer or ale. is brewed in hot weather, and put into chalky, gravelly, or sandy cellars, and especially if the-windows open to the south, so.uth-east, or south-west, then it is very likely it will not keep long, but be muddy and stale : Therefore, to keep beer in such a cellar, it should be brewed in-Oftober, that the drink may have time to cure kfelf before the hot weather comes on ; but, in wettilh or dampr cellars, it is best to brew in March, that the drink may have time to fine and settle before the winter weather is advanced. Now, cellars should have double or treble doors, that the outer one may be shut before the inner one is opened, to keep the air out. If a cellar see kept dry, and have double doors, it is reckoned warm in winter, and cool in summer. But the best of ceiims are thought to be those in chalks,, gravels, or sands; and particularly in chalks, which’are of a drying quality more .than any other, and ccnfequently tiifiipati: damps ; which contributes much to the \\' gook keeping of the drink, for all damp cellars are prejudicial to the preservation of beers and ales, and sooner bring on the rotting of the casks and hoops than the dry ones. Besides, in such inclofed cellars and temperate air, the beers and ales ripen triore kindly, are better digested and softened, and drink smoother : But, when the temperature of the air in the cellar is unequal, the drink soon grows stale. Though malt-liquor be truly brewed, yet it is often (\\' polled in a bad cellar, that occasions such alternate fermentations as to make it thick and four, though it sometimes happens that after such changes it fines itself again.\\' To prevent these commotions of the beer, some brew theirpale malt in March, and their brown in Oftober ; because the pale malt, having not fp many fiery particles in it as the brown, (lands more in need of the summer s weather to ripen it, while the brown sort, being more hard and dry, is better able to defend itself against the winter-colds that will help to smooth its harsh particles ; yet, when they happen to be too Violent, horse-dung (hould be laid to the windows as a fortification apainii them. Some are of ppinion, that Oftober is the best of all other months to brew any sort of malt in, by reason there are so many cold months dire&ly following, that will digest the drink and make it much excel that brewed in March, because such beer will not want that care and watching, as that brewed in March absolutely requires, by often taking out and putting in the vent-peg on change of weather ; and, if it is always left out, then it deadens and palls the drink; yet,-if due care is not taken in this refpeft, a thunder or stormy night may marr all, by making the drink ferment and burst the ca(k; for which redfon, as iron hoops are most in fashion at this time, they are certainly the greatest security to the safety of the drink thus exposed; and next to tliem is the chefnut-hoop; both which will endure a (horter or longer time, as the cellar is more or less dry, and according to the management attending them : The iron hoops generally begin to mil first at the edges, and therefore ftiould be rubbed off, and be kept from wet as much as poflihle. Of Cleaning and Sweetening of Casks. In case your c?.(k is a butt, then with cold water rinse out the lees clean, and. have ready boiling or very hot water, which put in, and, with a Jong dale $nd a little birch fastened to its end, scrub the bottom as well as voir can : At the \\' same time let there be, provided another (hotter broom of about a foot and a half long, that with one hand may be so employe-d In the upper and other parts as to clean the case well : So in a hogshead, or other, smaller vessel, the one-handed (hart broom may be used with water, or with water, fjmd, or a(hes, and be effeftually cleaned; the outside of the. calk about the bung-hole (hould be well waftred, left-the yeast, as it works over, carry some of its filth with it. But, to sweeten a barrel, kilderkin, firkin, or pin, in the great hxewhoufes, they put them over the copperholeJi-ole for a night together, that the (leant of the boiling water or wort may penetrate into the wood ; this way is such a furious fearcher, that unless the cade is new-hopped just before, it will be apt to fall to pieces. Another Way. Take a pottle, or more, of stone-lime, and put it into the calk^ on this pour some water, and stop it up diredtly, (baking it well about. Another Way.

Those that are burnt in a kiln, are firll set or placed in it, and then the kiln being covered with pieces of bricks, they put in some wood to dry them with a gentle fire ; and this they continue till the bricks are pretty dry, which is known by the smoke’s turning from a darkifh colour to a transparent smoke: They then leave off putting in wood, and proceed to make ready for burning, which is performed by putting in brulh, furze, spray, heath, brake, or fern-faggots; but before they put in any. faggots, they dam up the mouth or .mouths of the kiln with pieces of bricks (which they call Jhinlog) piled up one upon another, and close it up with wet brick-earth, inllead of mortar. The fhinlog they make so high, that there is but just room above it to thrust in a faggot; then they proceed to put in more faggots, till the kiln and its arches look white, and the fire appears at the top of the kiln ; upon which they slacken the fire for an hour, and let all cool by degrees.

       "\"Whett feeds are thus sufficiently malted, they mult be dried in malt-kilns, the fuel of which ftiould smoke as little as poflible.—The hulks mull now be broke open by malt-milns, and then infused or riialh’ed nn warm water, in order to extradt the faccharine substance; the heat applied Ihould be very slow and gradual.\\nThus it may lie and be worked on the floor in several parallels, two or three feet thick, ten or more feet broad, and fourteen or more in length, to chip or spire, but not too much nor too fast; and when it is come enough, it is to be turned twelve or sixteen times in twenty four hours, if the season is warm, as in March, April, or May; and when it is fixed, and the root begins to be dead then it must be thickened again, and carefully kept often turned and worked, that the growing of the root may not revive, and this is better done with the Sloes off than on : And here the Workman’s art and diligence ia particular is tried, in keeping the floor clear, and turning the malt often, that it neither moulds nor acre-spires, that is, that the blade does not grow out at the opposite end of the root; for, if it does, the flower and strength of the malt is gone, and nothing left behind but the acre-spire, hulk, and tail: Now, when it is at this degree, and sit for the kiln, it is often put into a heap, and let lie twelve hours before it is turned, to heat and mellow, which wilf much improve the malt if it is done with moderation, and after that time it must be turned every six hours during twenty-four ; but if it is overheated, it will become like grease and be spoiled, or at least cause the drink to be unwholesome.\\nWhen this operation is over, it then must be put on the kiln, to dry four, six, or twelve hours, according to the nature of the malt; for the pale sort requires more leisure, and less fire, than the amber or brown sorts: Three inches thick was formerly thought a sufficient depth for the malt to lie on the hair-cloth ; but now six is often allowed it; fourteen of sixteen feet square will dry about two quarters, if the malt lies four inches thick, and here it ftiould be turned every two, three, or four hours, keeping the hair cloth clear: The time of preparing it from the cistern to the kiln is uncertain, according to the season of the year; in moderate weather, three weeks are often sufficient.\\nThe iron and tiled ones were chiefly invented for drying of brown malts, and saving of fuel; for these, when they come to be thorough hot, will make the corns crack and jump by the fierceness of their heat, so that they will be roasted or fcorcbed in a little time ; and after they are off the kiln, to plump the body of the corn, and make it take the eye, some will sprinkle water over it, that it may meet with the better market: But if such malt is not used quickly, it will slacken and lose its spirits to a great degree, and perhaps, in half a year or less, may be taken by the whools and spoiled.\\nBut the coak is reckoned by most to exceed all others for making drink of the finest flavour and pale colour, because it sends no smoke forth to hurt the malt with any offensive tang, that wood, fern, and straw are apt to doin a lefler or greater degree; but there is a difference part of it of a hard<barley nature, and weigh heavier than even in what is called coak, the right sort being large that which is true malt.\\nsome wrongly called choak, and rightly named culm or Welch-coal, from Swanzey in Pembrokeshire, being of a hard stony substance, in small bits, resembling a fhinning coal, and will burn without smoke, and by its fulphureous effluvia call a most excellent whiteness on all the outward parts of the grainy body: In Devonfflire their marble or grey fxre-stone is burnt into lime with the strong fire that this culm makes, and both this and the chalked pit-coal afford a moderate and certain fire to all malt that is dried by it.\\nThis untimely making of malt often occasions bad ales and beers; for such malt retaining some of its barley nature* or that the season of the year is not cold enough to admit of its natural working on the floor, is not capable of producing a true malt, but will cause its drink to (link in the calk instead of growing sit for use, as not having its genuine malt nature to cure and preserve it, which all good malts contribute to as well as the hop.\\n-The pale malt is the slowest and flackeft dried of any, and where it has had a leisure fire, a sufficient time allowed it on the kiln, and a due care taken of it, the flour of the grain will remain in its full quantity, and thereby produce a greater length of wort than the brown high-dried malt.\\nIts colour is pleasant, its taste agreeable, and its nature wholesome, which makes it be preferred by many as the best of malts ; this by some is brewed either with hard or soft waters, or a mixture of both.\\nThis malt, by some, is thought to occasion the gravel or stone, and is by its steely nature Ids nourilhing than the pale or amber malts, being very much impregnated with the fiery particles of the kiln, and therefore its drink sooner becomes ftiarp and acid than that made from the pale or amber sorts, if they are all fairly brewed: For this reason the London brewers mostly use the Thames or, New River waters to brew this malt with, for the sake of its lost nature, whereby it agrees with the harfli qualities of it better than any of the well or other hard sorts, and makes a luscious ale for a little while, and abut-beer, or porter, that will keep very wdl five or six months ; but after that time it ge; nerally grows stale, notwithstanding there be ten or twelve bushels allowed to the hogftiead, and it be hopped ac» cordingly.\\nThe coak or Welch coal also makes more true and compleat malt than any other fuel, because its fire gives both a gentle and certain heat, whereby the corns are in all their parts gra-i dually, dried; and therefore of late these malts have gained such a reputation, that great quantities have been consumed in most parts, of the nation for their whole-t some nature and sweet fine taste.\\nTwts article' Well deserves the notice of all brewers, for on it the goodness of our drink greatly depends ; because, if it is ground too small, the flour of the malt will -be the easier and more freely mixed with the water, and will cause the wort to run thick; therefore the malt must be only just broke in the mill, to make it emit its spirit gradually, and incorporate its flour with the water in such a manner, that sir-st a stout beer, : then an ale, and afterwards a small beer may be had at one and the same brewing, and the wort run off fine and clear to the last.\\nTwts article' Well deserves the notice of all brewers, for on it the goodness of our drink greatly depends ;
