These are the cbeapeft of ail others to furnish a person readily with, as being many of them good calks for malt-liquors, because the sack and white-wine sorts are already seasoned to. hand, and will greatly improve beers and ales that are put in them : But beware of the Rheniih wine calks for strong drinks ; for its wood is so tinctured with this lharp wine, that\" it will hardly ever be free of it; and therefore such calk is best used for small beer: the claret calk will a great deal sooner be brought into a serviceable state for holding strong drink, if it is two or three times fealded with grounds of barrels, and afterwards used for small beer for some time. But to cure a claret-calk of its colour and taste, put a peck of stone-liroe into a hoglhead, and pour upon it three pails of water; bung immediately with a wood or cork-bung, and lhake it well about a quarter of an hour, and let ,it Hand a day and night, and it will bring off the red colour, and alter the taste of the calk very much. B R I BRICK, a. sat reddilh earth, formed into long, squares, . four inches broad, and eight or nine long; by means of a wooden mould, and then baked or burnt in a kiln,-to lerve the purposes of building. Bricks are of great antiquity, as appears by the-sacred writings, the tower and walls of Babylon being with them. In the east, they baked their bricks in the sun; the Romans tiled them unburnt, only leaving them to dry for four or five years in the air. The Greeks chiefly tiled three kinds of bricks ; the first whereof was called \\\\dtd(lron,~\\\\ i. e. of two palms ; the second, \\\\tetrad6ron\\\\, of four palms ; the third, X_pentad6ren~\\\\, of five palms. They hadalfo other bricks, just half each of those, to render their works more solid, and also more agreeable to the sight,\\'by the diverfities of the figures and sizes of the bricks. Pliny says, that to make good bricks they must hot consist of any earth that isfuil of Land or gravel, nor of such as is gritty or stony; but of a greyish mail, or whitilh chalky clay, or at least of a reddilh earth : He also adds, that the best season for making bricks is the spring; because, if mitde in summer, they will ba..fubjeft to crack, and be full of chinks. He dire&s, that the loam of which bricks are made be well ste\\' eped and wrought with water. Bricks, among us, are various, according to their various forms, dimensions, dies, method of making, ebc. the principal of which are, Compass-bricks, of a circular form, used infleyning of walls : Concave, or hollow bricks, on one side flat like a common brick, on the other hollowed, and used for conveyance of water : Feather-edged bricks, which are like common llatute bricks, only thinner on one edge than the other, and used for penning up the brick pannels in timber buildings: Cogging bricks are used for making the indented works under the caping of walls built with great bricks : Caping bricks, formed on purpose for caping of walls: Dutch or Flemilh bricks, used to pave yards, stables, and for soap-bo Hers vaults and cifterns: Clinkers, such bricks as are glazed by the heat of the fire in making : Sandel or famel-bricks, are such as lie outmoll in a kiln, or clamp, and consequently are soft and useless, as not being thoroughly burnt: Great bricks are those twelve inches long, six broad, and three thick, used to build fence-walls: _Plai%r or\\'buttress bricks, have a notch at one end, half the breadth of the brick ; their use is to bind the work which is built of great bricks: Statute-bricks or frnall common bricks, ought, when burnt, to be nine inches long, four and a quarter broad, and two and a half thick ; they are commonly used in.paving cellars, Bricks are burnt either in a kiln or clamp. Those that are burnt in a kiln, are firll set or placed in it, and then the kiln being covered with pieces of bricks, they put in some wood to dry them with a gentle fire ; and this they continue till the bricks are pretty dry, which is known by the smoke’s turning from a darkifh colour to a transparent smoke: They then leave off putting in wood, and proceed to make ready for burning, which is performed by putting in brulh, furze, spray, heath, brake, or fern-faggots; but before they put in any. faggots, they dam up the mouth or .mouths of the kiln with pieces of bricks (which they call Jhinlog) piled up one upon another, and close it up with wet brick-earth, inllead of mortar. The fhinlog they make so high, that there is but just room above it to thrust in a faggot; then they proceed to put in more faggots, till the kiln and its arches look white, and the fire appears at the top of the kiln ; upon which they slacken the fire for an hour, and let all cool by degrees. This they continue to do, alternately heating and flacking, till the ware be, thoroughly burnt, which is usually effected in forty About London they chiefly burn in clamps, built of the bricks themselves, after the manner of arches in kilns, with a vacancy between each brick, for the fire to play through ; but with this difference, that instead of arching, they span it over by making the bricks project one over another on both sides of the place, for.the wood and coals to lie in till they meet, and are bounded by the bricks at the top, which cfofe all up. The place for the fuel is carried up strait on botsh sides, till about three feet high ; then they almost fill it with wood, and over that lay a covering of sea-coal, and then overfpan the arch; but they strew sea-coal also over the clamp, betwixt all the rows of bricks; lastly, they kindle the wood, which gives fire to the coal ; and when all is burnt, then they conclude the bricks are sufficiently burnt. 0/7 ^ Bricks, olive oil imbibed by the substance of bricks, and afterwards distilled from it. This oil was once in great repute for curing many diseases, but is now entirely laid aside.-'"

the Romans tiled them unburnt, only leaving them to dry for four or five years in the air.: 1.483870967741935, The Greeks chiefly tiled three kinds of bricks ; the first whereof was called \\dtd(lron,~\\ i. e. of two palms ;

but of a greyish mail, or whitilh chalky clay, or at least of a reddilh earth : He also adds, that the best season for making bricks is the spring; because, if mitde in summer, they will ba..fubjeft to crack, and be full of chinks.: 3.419354838709676, He dire&s, that the loam of which bricks are made be well ste' eped and wrought with water.: 1.4193548387096773, Bricks, among us, are various, according to their various forms, dimensions, dies, method of making, ebc.: 0.4838709677419354, the principal of which are, Compass-bricks, of a circular form, used infleyning of walls : Concave, or hollow bricks, on one side flat like a common brick, on the other hollowed, and used for conveyance of water : Feather-edged bricks, which are like common llatute bricks, only thinner on one edge than the other, and used for penning up the brick pannels in timber buildings: Cogging bricks are used for making the indented works under the caping of walls built with great bricks : Caping bricks, formed on purpose for caping of walls: Dutch or Flemilh bricks, used to pave yards, stables, and for soap-bo Hers vaults and cifterns: Clinkers, such bricks as are glazed by the heat of the fire in making : Sandel or famel-bricks, are such as lie outmoll in a kiln, or clamp, and consequently are soft and useless, as not being thoroughly burnt: Great bricks are those twelve inches long, six broad, and three thick, used to build fence-walls: _Plai%r or'buttress bricks, have a notch at one end, half the breadth of the brick ; their use is to bind the work which is built of great bricks: Statute-bricks or frnall common bricks, ought, when burnt, to be nine inches long, four and a quarter broad, and two and a half thick ; they are commonly used in.paving cellars, Bricks are burnt either in a kiln or clamp.: 22.32258064516131, Those that are burnt in a kiln, are firll set or placed in it, and then the kiln being covered with pieces of bricks, they put in some wood to dry them with a gentle fire ; and this they continue till the bricks are pretty dry, which is known by the smoke’s turning from a darkifh colour to a transparent smoke: They then leave off putting in wood, and proceed to make ready for burning, which is performed by putting in brulh, furze, spray, heath, brake, or fern-faggots; but before they put in any.: 5.064516129032256, faggots, they dam up the mouth or .mouths of the kiln with pieces of bricks (which they call Jhinlog) piled up one upon another, and close it up with wet brick-earth, inllead of mortar.: 1.935483870967742, The fhinlog they make so high, that there is but just room above it to thrust in a faggot; then they proceed to put in more faggots, till the kiln and its arches look white, and the fire appears at the top of the kiln ; upon which they slacken the fire for an hour, and let all cool by degrees.: 1.8387096774193548, This they continue to do, alternately heating and flacking, till the ware be, thoroughly burnt, which is usually effected in forty About London they chiefly burn in clamps, built of the bricks themselves, after the manner of arches in kilns, with a vacancy between each brick, for the fire to play through ; but with this difference, that instead of arching, they span it over by making the bricks project one over another on both sides of the place, for.the wood and coals to lie in till they meet, and are bounded by the bricks at the top, which cfofe all up.: 5.193548387096773, The place for the fuel is carried up strait on botsh sides, till about three feet high ; then they almost fill it with wood, and over that lay a covering of sea-coal, and then overfpan the arch; but they strew sea-coal also over the clamp, betwixt all the rows of bricks; lastly, they kindle the wood, which gives fire to the coal ; and when all is burnt, then they conclude the bricks are sufficiently burnt.: 4.612903225806451, 0/7 ^ Bricks, olive oil imbibed by the substance of bricks, and afterwards distilled from it.: 1.3225806451612903, This oil was once in great repute for curing many diseases, but is now entirely laid aside.-: 0.38709677419354827}\n"
