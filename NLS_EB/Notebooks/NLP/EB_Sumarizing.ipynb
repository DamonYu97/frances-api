      "In boiling, both time and the curdling or breaking of the wort should be consulted ; for if a person was to boil the wort an hour, and then take it out of the copper before it was rightly broke, it would be wrong management, and the drink would not be fine and wholesome; and if it Ihould boil an hour and a half, or two hours, without regarding when its particles are in a right order, then it may be too thick; so that due care must be had to the two extremes, to obtain it in its due order; therefore, in Odtober and keeping beers, an hour and a quarter’s good boiling is commonly sufficient to have a thorough cured drink; for generally in that time it will break and boil enough ; because in this there is a double security by length of boiling, and a quantity of hops shifted ; but in the new way there is only a single one, and that is by a double or treble allowance of fresh hops boiled only half an hour in the wort; and for this practice a reason is afligned, that the hops, being endowed with difeutient apertive qualities, will, by them and their great quantity, supply the defedt of underboiling the wort; and that a farther conveniency is here enjoyed by having only the fine, wholesome, strong, floury, fpirituous parts of the hop in the drink, exclufiye of the phlegmetic, earthy parts which would be extradhed, if the hops were to be boiled above half an hour; and therefore there are many now that are so attached to this new method, that they will not brew ale or beer any other way, thinking, that if hops are boiled above thirty minutes, the wort will exhibit some of their bad qualities. The first full copper of boiling water he puts into the mafh-tub, there to lie a quarter of an hour, till the ffeam is so far spent that he can see his face in it; or, as soon as the hot water is put in, throws a pail or two of cold water into it, which will bring it at once into a temper ; then he lets three bulhels of malt be run leisurely into it, and stirred or malhed all the while, but as little as can be, or no more than just to keep the malt from clotting or balling; when that is done, he puts one bushel of dry malt at th<i top, to keep in the vapour or spirit, and so lets if stand covered two hours, or till the neat copper-full of water is boiling hot, which he lades over the malt or goods three hand-bowls full at a time, that are to run off at the cock or tap by a very small st ream before more is put on, which again must be returned into the mafti tub till it comes off exceeding fine ;■ for, u' nless the wort is clear when it goes into the copper, there are little hopes it will be so in the barrel ; which leisure way obliges him to be sixteen hours in brewing these four buffels of malt. the principal of which are, Compass-bricks, of a circular form, used infleyning of walls : Concave, or hollow bricks, on one side flat like a common brick, on the other hollowed, and used for conveyance of water : Feather-edged bricks, which are like common llatute bricks, only thinner on one edge than the other, and used for penning up the brick pannels in timber buildings: Cogging bricks are used for making the indented works under the caping of walls built with great bricks : Caping bricks, formed on purpose for caping of walls: Dutch or Flemilh bricks, used to pave yards, stables, and for soap-bo Hers vaults and cifterns: Clinkers, such bricks as are glazed by the heat of the fire in making : Sandel or famel-bricks, are such as lie outmoll in a kiln, or clamp, and consequently are soft and useless, as not being thoroughly burnt: Great bricks are those twelve inches long, six broad, and three thick, used to build fence-walls: _Plai%r or'buttress bricks, have a notch at one end, half the breadth of the brick ; their use is to bind the work which is built of great bricks: Statute-bricks or frnall common bricks, ought, when burnt, to be nine inches long, four and a quarter broad, and two and a half thick ; they are commonly used in.paving cellars, Bricks are burnt either in a kiln or clamp.\n"
